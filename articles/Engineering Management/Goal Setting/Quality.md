- Improve code quality to reduce technical debt
  title:: Quality
  
  Write quality code that does what it’s intended to do, follows a consistent style, is easy to understand, is well documented, and can be tested. 
  Focus on readability, [[Performance]] , maintainability, reliability/resiliency, and [[Security]] .

#### Goal-Oriented Ideas
- Remove legacy code that is no longer in use.
- Take time to separate the code and use the object oriented design approach you’ve heard so much about.
- Allow time for refactoring, clean the code up when you have the opportunity. Don’t forget to run your tests again!
- If your team doesn’t have a coding standard work to put one in place, don’t assume others will look at code for examples.
- Once the standards are in place paired programming and code reviews can ensure proper technique and also help develop the programmer’s skill set.
