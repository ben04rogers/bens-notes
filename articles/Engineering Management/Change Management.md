## ADKAR Model

The ADKAR model is an outcome-oriented change management method that aims to limit resistance to organizational change. It is based on five building blocks that bring about successful change, and each letter in the ADKAR acronym represents a different step in the change management process. The five steps are:

1. **Awareness:** This involves understanding the need for change and becoming aware of the implications of not changing. Leaders need to create awareness of the need for change among people who will be impacted by it.
2. **Desire:** Once people are aware of the need for change, they need to be motivated to make it happen. Leaders need to create a desire for change in individuals by explaining why it is essential and what benefits it will bring.
3. **Knowledge:** In this step, people need to be provided with the right information and knowledge about the change that is happening. Leaders should provide training and instruction to individuals on how to make the change happen.
4. **Ability:** Individuals need to possess the skills and resources necessary to make the change happen. Leaders need to provide the necessary resources and support to ensure that individuals can execute the change.
5. **Reinforcement:** In the final step, individuals need to be supported in maintaining the change. Leaders should continue to provide reinforcement to ensure that the change sticks and becomes a permanent part of the organization.

The ADKAR model is a widely used framework for managing organizational change. It provides a structured approach to change management that helps to minimize resistance and create a successful transition.

## What is the CLARC framework?

The CLARC framework is a change management model that helps people managers navigate change effectively. CLARC stands for:

- C: Communicate clearly
- L: Lead with empathy
- A: Align to the vision
- R: Respect the individual
- C: Create momentum

This framework is based on the ADKAR model, which describes the stages an individual goes through during change: Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement. By fulfilling each of the CLARC roles, people managers can have a positive impact on an individual's journey through each stage of the ADKAR mode.
