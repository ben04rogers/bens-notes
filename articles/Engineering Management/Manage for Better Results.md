**Individual Results**

- Set clear expectations with individuals and write them down to remember make it clearer
- Gain agreement and commitment
- Align personal goals with the team and organization goals
- HAVE 1:1s regularly (enable the team / goal check / pulse check)

**Team Results**

- Clarify Team Roles
- Smart goals and Metrics (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
**Specific**: Goals should be clear and well-defined. They should answer the questions of who, what, where, when, and why. Being specific helps to avoid ambiguity and provides a clear direction.

**Measurable**: Goals should have specific criteria or metrics that can be used to track progress and determine when the goal has been achieved. Measurable goals provide a way to objectively assess success and make adjustments if necessary.

**Achievable**: Goals should be realistic and attainable. It's important to set goals that are challenging but still within reach. Setting unattainable goals can lead to frustration and demotivation.

**Relevant**: Goals should be aligned with broader objectives and have a meaningful impact. They should be relevant to the individual or organization's overall vision and mission. Relevance ensures that goals are worth pursuing and contribute to overall success.

**Time-bound**: Goals should have a specific timeframe or deadline for completion. Setting a timeline helps to create a sense of urgency and provides a clear target to work towards. It also helps with planning and prioritization.
