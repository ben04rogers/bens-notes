### rmdir
The `rmdir /s /q "folder_name"` command is used to delete a directory and all its contents in [[Windows]] Command Prompt (CMD) without sending them to the Recycle Bin.

Parameters:

- `/s` is a switch for "subdirectories" that tells the command to remove all files and directories within the specified directory/folder, including any subdirectories.
- `/q` is a switch for "quiet mode" that tells the command to operate quietly without asking for confirmation from the user.
- `"folder_name"` is the path of the directory/folder that you want to delete. Make sure to enclose the folder name/path in double quotes if it contains spaces or special characters.
